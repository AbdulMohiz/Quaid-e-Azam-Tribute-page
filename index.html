Jinnah was one of the most expensive and most sought after lawyers of his time, earning around Rs1,500 per case. The Founder of Pakistan, however, fixed his salary at Rs1 per month as the Governor General of Pakistan. The reason being, he didn’t want to indebt the nascent state with financial burden. </li>
  <li><strong>His political decisions were as precise as his billiard shots</strong>

One of the most prolific and controversial writers of British India, Saadat Hasan Manto wrote in his book, Jinnah Sahib: “As in billiards, he would examine the situation from every angle and only move when he was sure he would get it right the first time.” </li>
  
  <li><strong>He never wore the same tie twice</strong>

Jinnah was a classy gentleman and he never wore the same tie twice. Even on his deathbed he insisted to be formally dressed saying: “I will not travel in my pajamas.”</li>
  <li><strong>The Jinnah Cap has its own significance
    </strong>
In different portraits, Jinnah is often seen sporting a sherwani and a Qaraquli cap (now known as the Jinnah Cap). This particular outfit, wore by Jinnah in 1937 during a session of All-India Muslim League in Lucknow, was meant to signify his commitment to Allama Mohammad Iqbal’s dream of a separate nation for Muslims of British India.</li>
  <li><strong>A road in Turkey is named after the Quaid-e-Azam</strong>

Ankara, the capital of Turkey, has a street named after him. Cinnah Caddesi is one of the longest streets of Ankara. “Jinnah” is spelled “Cinnah” in the Turkish language.</li>
  <li><strong>He was the youngest Indian to pass law examination</strong>

Muhammad Ali Jinnah , in 1896, became the youngest Indian to pass law examination in England. At a remarkable age of 20 Jinnah was the only Muslim Barrister in the city of Bombay. He would later go on to become of the most successful lawyers of his time and the rest his history.</li>
